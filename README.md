# Habitat selection in changing environments

## Purpose

Habitat selection behavior in dispersal could affect the stability of populations, particularly when the environment is changing. How do environmental change and habitat selection interact to affect long-term population stability?

## Work in progress

Currently, this model incorporates environmental change, and visualizes habitat selection across the landscape. There are no populations or stability measures incorporated yet.
